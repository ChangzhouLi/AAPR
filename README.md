# AAPR
- This code is based on: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03977">Automatic Academic Paper Rating Based on Modularized Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Network</a>
- The dataset for the AAPR task is available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DbYWVXt_J_6wAgjzVh9LG_MG1UCjBQuS/view?usp=sharing
- For the AAPR dataset, you can process the latex source data in your own way (e.g. considering the number of formulas or charts). The script clean_latex.py provides an optional way of initial rough processing.
